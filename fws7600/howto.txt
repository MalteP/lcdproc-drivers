Aaeon FWS-7600 LCM howto for lcdproc
by Malte Pöggel <malte.poeggel@securepoint.de>

=== Downloading & Unpacking ===

Download lcdproc 0.5.5:
wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/lcdproc/lcdproc/0.5.5/lcdproc-0.5.5.tar.gz

Unzip and change into the directory:
tar xfvz lcdproc-0.5.5.tar.gz
cd lcdproc-0.5.5


=== Patching ===

Now download the patch file into the lcdproc directory, then patch it:
wget http://chaoscode.eu/data/lcdproc/fws7600/aaeon-lcm-0.5.5.patch
patch -p1 -i aaeon-lcm-0.5.5.patch


=== Compiling ===

Compiling works as usual. We need to specify the hd44780 driver as it is not build by default.

./configure --enable-drivers=hd44780
make
sudo make install


=== Configuring ===

Before we can use the LCDd, its configuration needs some changes.
Delete the original configuration and update it with the new one.

cd /usr/local/etc
rm -f LCDd.conf
wget http://chaoscode.eu/data/lcdproc/fws7600/LCDd.conf


=== Starting ===

You're done! Simply start the LCDd.

sudo /usr/local/sbin/LCDd

If everything's ok, the server screen should appear on the LC display.
It is listening on 127.0.0.1:13666 for connections from clients.

Have fun =)
